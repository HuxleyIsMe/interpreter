# On building a JSX parser 

Ok in order to build a JSX parser we need to first come up with some rules, specify the scope of what we are looking
at and be happy!

## **Assumptions**

- ONE PARENT ELEMENT (but lol how to enforce)

## step 1: charmander

Take raw JSX and convert it -> 

i.e.. <div><h1>HelloWorld</h1></div>

Ok thoughts 

- if we can assume one parent then we can assume our root to be a div but this must be checked
- Every block element
- are we validating HTML? No that might be to complicated for now
- ok so just takey take the elements and pop em up into a tree? ( yeah because then we can use a tree walker hehehehe)
